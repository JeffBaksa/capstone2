# Capstone 2 Project Proposals

## Proposal 1    
**Desc:**  Ideally I'd like to try to web scrape images of poison ivy and other similar looking plants and classify them against each other as either "is poison ivy" or "is not poison ivy". Given my background in agricultural economics I think it'd be beneficial to identify damaging/invasive species. On a more personal level, working on a golf course I frequently dealt with the effects of the plant and it drove me mad. I want to be able to identify it better so that I can avoid it all costs. I'd need to spend some time learning how to webscrape better over solo week in order to get the images to where I could then classify them using a convolutional NN. If webscraping doesn't work out I also found [this](https://github.com/bazilione/poison_ivy) dataset someone else created, but it's only 220 images total which I'm not sure would be enough to create a decently accurate model.

## Proposal 2
**Link:** [Intel Image Classification (Natural Scenes Around the World)](https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification)

**Desc:** This is a more direct approach to the problem with the advantage of using a Kaggle dataset that is already split into training and testing folders. The image data is of natural scenes around the world. This data contains around 25k images distributed under 6 categories; buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street. Again, I would classify the images using a CNN and think it would be somewhat beneficial/applicable for someone with an Ag background to be able to identify different natural scenes. Ideally would like to avoid using a Kaggle dataset this capstone though. Thinking ahead to capstone 3 as well, it seems like this could be a project that I could expand on to create a recommender that would take in an image and recommend a new destination based on the natural scenery around you. 

## Proposal 3

**Link:** [Leaf Disease Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/sizlingdhairya1/leaf-disease)

**Desc:**  This dataset contains 239 images of different leaf diseases split into 5 categories; bacteria, fungi, nematodes, normal, and virus. I would again, classify these images using a CNN. As you can tell by now I'm trying to work with some dataset that is applicable to the agriculture sector and disease recognition would be very applicable and beneficial so that farms can identify diseases that may be spreading throughout their crops more quickly and accurately.
